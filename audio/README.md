# Background Music

This directory should contain the background music file for the Find Meow game.

## Required File
- `background-music.mp3` - A looping background music track (retro/casual game style recommended)

## Recommendations
- Duration: 30-60 seconds (will loop)
- Style: Light, playful, retro game music
- Volume: Moderate (not too loud)
- Format: MP3 for broad browser compatibility

## Free Music Resources
You can find royalty-free music from:
- YouTube Audio Library
- Incompetech (Kevin MacLeod)
- Free Music Archive
- Bensound

## Temporary Solution
Until you add a music file, the soundbar will still function visually, but won't play audio. The code handles missing audio files gracefully.
